## Common NFVI Telco Task Force (CNTT)

The main motivation of CNTT is to reduce the time and cost for VNF Certifications. The current bottleneck is that there is no limit on the number of VIM/NFVIs on which the VNF certifications to be performed and the base VIM services. This needs a standardization of VIM/NFVI.

CNTT was started by telecom operators and they are engaged for the standardization. Vendors are also participating. The result standardized VIM/NFVI still should be able to serve as a basis for telco workloads.
